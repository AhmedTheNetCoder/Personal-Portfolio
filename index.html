        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am Ahmed Al-Khaldi, a passionate Computer Engineering student with a strong focus on front-end development, UX/UI design, and cybersecurity advocacy. My journey in tech has been marked by numerous achievements, including winning First Place in the Logistics Category at the Sas48 Green Tech Hackathon 2024, where my team developed an innovative IoT waste management solution that reduced costs and carbon emissions by 35%.

        I also secured Second Place at the OQ Hackathon 2024 and actively participated in the NBO Hackathon 2024, collaborating with teams to create impactful solutions in logistics and financial management for SMEs. My dedication to sustainability and innovation is further reflected in my role as a co-founder of EcoSense, a company committed to optimizing waste management and promoting eco-friendly practices.

        As the President of the NU Chess Club, I value strategic thinking and teamwork, which I apply in all my projects. Iâ€™m eager to connect with like-minded professionals and explore opportunities where I can contribute my skills and passion for technology to drive meaningful change.</p>
